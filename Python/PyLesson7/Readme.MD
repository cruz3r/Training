# Pandas

- python -m venv $pwd.path
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install openpyxl
pip install pyqt5
pip install -U ipykernel
pip install lxml
pip install requests
pip install html5lib
- Do you remember why we would use venv?

- What is Numpy?
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

Sounds complicated to me so I did some digging and it has a lot to do with math, arrays, speed, and resources
- Why would you use Numpy?
Your a Data Scientist, you have very large data sets, you want to deal with your data faster and use less resources
- Would I use this on a regular basis?
Depends on your job or what your goal is. I may not use this on a regular basis. I can't tell you what will happen tomorrow but hearing these terms and having a generic understanding is always useful.

- What is Pandas?  
pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

Sounds easier than numpy but it's built on numpy so it's a tool built with another tool
- Why would you use Pandas?  
You have data, you want to read data, you want to transform data
- Did you really have to use the word data that many times? 
Maybe
